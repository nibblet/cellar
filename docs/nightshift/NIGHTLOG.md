## Run: 2026-05-30

### Summary
- Scanned: full codebase first run — App Router routes, server actions, lib/, supabase/migrations/, AI/OpenAI layer, cellar/taste/pairing engine, RLS policies
- Issues: 5 new (FIX-001 through FIX-005), 0 existing, 0 resolved
- Ideas: 4 new seeds (IDEA-001 through IDEA-004); IDEA-001 and IDEA-003 immediately promoted to `planned`
- Plans written: 5 fix plans + 2 dev plans (7 total)

### Key Findings
- **Identity invariant violation** in `products/[id]/page.tsx`: contributor name built as inline template string instead of `formatMemberName()`. Small but the kind of thing that bites when `formatMemberName` evolves.
- **Invite server actions missing app-layer admin check**: `createInvite` / `revokeInvite` rely solely on RLS for authorization. RLS holds, but the error UX is broken and the defense-in-depth pattern used everywhere else is absent here.
- **Storage leak on signed-URL failure in capture**: uploaded photo is orphaned if `createSignedUrl` or `identifyAndPersist` fails. Low urgency for 12 users; cleanliness + future audit concern.
- **Shell layout DB query with empty string ID**: unauthenticated requests to shell routes fire a `.eq("id", "")` query. Harmless but wasteful; adding a redirect makes the auth posture explicit.
- **Cost optimization**: `cellar/insight` and `taste/rationale` use gpt-5-mini for structured JSON extraction tasks. Both should use gpt-5-nano (5–10x cheaper) per CLAUDE.md guidance. These are the highest-frequency per-member AI calls.

### Plans Ready to Execute
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-001-contributor-name.md` — 5-min fix: add formatMemberName import + use it for contributor string
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-002-invite-admin-check.md` — add requireAdminSupabase helper to invites actions
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-003-storage-leak.md` — add cleanup on signed-URL and identify-and-persist failures in capture
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-004-layout-empty-id.md` — add null guard + redirect before DB query in shell layout
- `docs/nightshift/plans/FIXPLAN-FIX-005-nano-for-json.md` — switch cellar insight + taste rationale to MODELS.json (gpt-5-nano)
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-001-tonights-pick.md` — Tonight's Pick Winston line on cellar page; 1-2 hours, zero AI cost
- `docs/nightshift/plans/DEVPLAN-IDEA-003-maker-pages.md` — Phase 9 Maker/Distillery pages; 4-6 hours, fully specced

### Recommendations
- **If you have 30 min:** Run through FIX-001 → FIX-005 in order. All are small, self-contained changes. Start with FIX-005 (nano for JSON) — it reduces ongoing AI cost every time a member visits their cellar with changed shelf contents.
- **If you have 2 hours:** Implement IDEA-001 (Tonight's Pick on Cellar page). It's a pure server component addition, reuses existing pick-pour infrastructure, costs $0 per render, and gives Winston a home on the cellar page.
- **If you have a full evening:** Begin Phase 9 (DEVPLAN-IDEA-003-maker-pages). Start with the DB migration + aggregator unit tests + slug utility (Phases 1–3). Those are self-contained and unblock the rest.
